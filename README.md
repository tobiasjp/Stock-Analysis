## Summary

The benefits of refactoring code is that you can apply the code to any set of data with the same structure as the code and analyze new sets of data.

The challenges of refactoring code is that you have to ensure the syntax syncs with the data in the set.  For example, setting the value of one variable at a certain index could give the incorrect value if the variable changes or the order of the array list in a variable set changes.
